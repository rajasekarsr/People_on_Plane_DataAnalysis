A data analysis on People Etiquettes on Air Travel using python

## People Etiquettes on Air
### "It is impossible to overlook the extent to which civilization is built upon a renunciation of instinct,‚Äù Sigmund Freud said.

There is always a tension between how much we need to follow our instrincts and how much we need to yeild to the social conventions. The people of different age behave differently in Airplane travel. I have been over the plane quiet a few time so far. I have seen people go "Errrrr !! I see a baby on next seat." on plane travels. This made me to search for data to analyse how people behave on airplanes.

The quick survey from fivethirthyeight.com will help us to find out the good-natured people on that we meet on flight travels.
I have used pandas, numpy and mathplot for this data analysis.
