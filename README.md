# People_on_Plane_DataAnalysis
A data analysis on People Etiquettes on Air Travel using python

## People Etiquettes on Air
### "It is impossible to overlook the extent to which civilization is built upon a renunciation of instinct,‚Äù Sigmund Freud said.

###### In this project, I did data analysis on person's etiquettes while they are travelling on plane. 
Specifically, I am focussing on people who are rude against others for some reasons. I have seen many people reacting on plane during the long journey for no reason. This is because the inner tension they have during long hour travels. This made me to search for data to analyse how people behave on airplanes.

The quick survey from fivethirthyeight.com will help us to find out the good-natured people on that we meet on flight travels.
I have used pandas, numpy and mathplot for this data analysis.
